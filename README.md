### AirsoftCalculator

Airsoft Calculator is designed for airsoft players who want to ensure their replica's power does not surpass 
legal limits. 
It calculates the energy in joules, allowing users to select the mass of the pellet (in grams) and enter the 
velocity (in fps or m/s) as measured by their chronograph.
